## [1.0.8] - 2025-08-31

### Fixes
- **Actually Intelligent IP Detection** - Ask HA Supervisor for the IP address
- **Fix POST to accessCloud.json** - It's POSTed, not GETten
- **Handle Mangled URLs** - Sengled firmware (maybe only some) mangles HTTP requests
- **Mosquitto broker config fix** - we don't need to specify 256MB when default & max is 256MB-1byte.
- **Killing Uvicorns** - woefully complex, overkill, and can't handle mangled URLs. Sorry friend!
