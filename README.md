# 🔦 Sengled Local Server - Home Assistant Add-on 💡

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> ⚠️ **Project Status: End of Maintenance**
>
> As of **December 2025**, this project is no longer actively maintained.
>
> This was the result of a quick flash of inspiration, hoping to inspire Sengled owners and developers to bring their devices local. Unfortunately, the project didn't take off and the flash of inspiration subsided as I moved my WiFi ESP-based devices to Tasmota. This system never fully worked properly or easily, and Sengled's servers came back online. Thus, this project is unmaintained.

**Keep your Sengled bulbs local and secure!** This add-on provides the essential HTTP and MQTT infrastructure needed to operate Sengled WiFi bulbs without cloud connectivity, seamlessly integrating with your Home Assistant setup.

## ✨ Features

- **🌐 HTTP Provisioning Server** - Serves critical endpoints on port 54448 ("light")
- **🔌 MQTT Broker with SSL** - Secure broker on port 28527 ("bulbs") 
- **🌉 Native MQTT Bridge** - Auto-forwards bulb data to your HA MQTT broker
- **🔒 Auto SSL Certificates** - Generates CA and server certificates for Sengled broker automatically
- **📊 Real-time Dashboard** - Monitor connections and activity at port 54448
- **🎯 Simple HTTP Server** - Lightweight, debuggable server handles malformed bulb requests  
- **🔧 Highly Configurable** - Fine-tune bridge settings through HA UI

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Install the Add-on

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and show the add add-on repository dialog with a specific repository URL pre-filled.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/supervisor_add_addon_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_add_addon_repository/?repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FFalconFour%2FHA-Sengled-Local-Server-AddOn)

1. Add this repository to your Home Assistant add-on store (link above)
2. Install the "Sengled Local Server" add-on
3. Configure your MQTT broker settings (see [Configuration](#configuration))
4. Start the add-on

### 2. Configure Your Bulbs

During WiFi setup, use your Home Assistant's IP address with these endpoints:

- **bimqtt endpoint**: `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/bimqtt`
- **accessCloud endpoint**: `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/accessCloud.json`

### 3. Monitor & Control

- **Dashboard**: Visit `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/` for real-time monitoring  
- **Health Check**: Monitor service health at `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/health`
- **Status API**: Get detailed statistics at `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/status`

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Basic Configuration

```yaml
mqtt_broker_host: "core-mosquitto"    # Your MQTT broker hostname/IP
mqtt_broker_port: 1883                # MQTT broker port  
mqtt_username: ""                     # MQTT username (if required)
mqtt_password: ""                     # MQTT password (if required)
mqtt_ssl: false                       # Enable if your broker uses SSL
enable_bridge: true                   # Forward bulb topics to your broker
log_level: "info"                     # debug, info, warning, error
auto_generate_certs: true             # Auto-generate SSL certificates
cert_common_name: "sengled.local"     # Certificate common name
```

### Advanced Configuration

For most users, the default settings work perfectly. Advanced users can:

- Disable bridging for standalone operation
- Provide custom SSL certificates
- Adjust logging levels for troubleshooting
- Configure specific MQTT credentials

## 🌉 How the MQTT Bridge Works

```
Sengled Bulb --SSL--> Local MQTT (28527) --Bridge--> Your MQTT Broker ---> Home Assistant
```

1. **Bulbs connect** to the local MQTT broker on port 28527 using SSL
2. **Topics are bridged** - `wifielement/*` topics are forwarded to your HA broker
3. **HA integration** can subscribe to these topics for bulb control and status

### Topic Structure

Bulbs publish to topics like:
- `wifielement/B0:CE:18:12:34:56/status` - Bulb status and attributes
- `wifielement/B0:CE:18:12:34:56/consumption` - Power consumption data
- `wifielement/B0:CE:18:12:34:56/consumptionTime` - Energy usage over time

And subscribe to:
- `wifielement/B0:CE:18:12:34:56/update` - Commands from HA

## 🔍 Monitoring & Diagnostics

### Dashboard Features

Visit `http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/` to access:

- **Service Status** - Real-time health of HTTP and MQTT services
- **Connection Stats** - Number of requests, unique clients, uptime
- **Certificate Info** - SSL certificate status and expiration
- **Network Details** - IP detection and interface information  
- **Activity Log** - Recent connections and events
- **Configuration View** - Current bridge settings

### Health Checks

The add-on includes comprehensive health monitoring:

```bash
# Quick health check
curl http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/health

# Detailed service status  
curl http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/status

# Network diagnostics
curl http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/network
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Bulbs Won't Connect

1. **Verify endpoints are accessible**:
   ```bash
   curl http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/bimqtt
   curl http://YOUR_HA_IP:54448/accessCloud.json
   ```

2. **Check the dashboard** for connection attempts and errors

3. **Verify certificates** are generated (check add-on logs)

4. **Ensure network connectivity** between bulbs and Home Assistant

### Bridge Issues

1. **Test MQTT broker connectivity**:
   ```bash
   mosquitto_pub -h YOUR_MQTT_HOST -t test/topic -m "test"
   ```

2. **Check bridge status** in the dashboard

3. **Verify credentials** if using authenticated MQTT

4. **Review logs** for connection errors

### Certificate Problems

1. **Restart the add-on** to regenerate certificates
2. **Check certificate common name** matches your setup  
3. **Verify file permissions** in `/data/certs/`

## 🔒 Security Considerations

**Why non-standard ports?** Since Sengled bulbs don't implement authentication, we use several hardening measures:

- **Custom port assignment** - You control exactly which ports bulbs connect to during WiFi setup
- **SSL encryption** protects MQTT communication with encrypted messages
- **Access control lists** limit bulbs to only their own topics (`wifielement/{MAC}/...`) 
- **Local-only operation** eliminates cloud dependencies and external attack vectors
- **Network isolation** possible by restricting these ports to your local network only

The port strategy provides **configurability and control** rather than relying on obscurity.

## 📋 API Reference
